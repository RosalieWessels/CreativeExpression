  <p>As many of my friends were not particating in the holiday fair in 8th grade, I partenered with Alexa. We were already really good friends and doing this together made our bond even stronger. We wanted to sell pendants in the Egan colors: blue and yellow. We designed a pendant that has a viking hat on it, representing the Egan Vikings. The pendant consists of a front and a back. The front, with the viking helmet, was blue. The back was yellow. After a lot of 3d printing, we were able to start selling them. Although they did not sell very fast (or maybe it seemed like it because the macarons next to us were going really fast :), we still sold about all of them (20). In conclusion, the holiday fair was so much fun during both years and I will miss it when I am in high school next year.</p>
