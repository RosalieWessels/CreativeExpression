  <p>I took Computer Science during the first semester in 7th grade. The teacher was Mrs. V. One day, Mahika had asked Mrs. V. whether she knew any people that would like to participate in the Technovation Challenge. Mrs. V. recommended my name. Mahika came to talk to me about the Technovation Challenge. The Technovation Challenge is a competition where every team creates an app that solves a problem in their community. I was super excited to participate! Julia joined our team and we started learning Swift, the Apple Developer's language. Together, we built Studify, a homework helping app with a competitive feature. In May 2018, we went to pitch our app during the Regional Pitch Events in San Francisco. Only two out of twenty teams would go on to the semi finals. After an awesome day of presenting our app and watching other people's pitches about their apps, we got chosen as one of the teams to move on to the semi finals. I was so happy! Although we did not end up getting into the Finals, it was still a lot of fun! </p>
