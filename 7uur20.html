  <p>For the Holiday Fair in 7th grade, Julia and I sold oublie waffels and bounty balls. The oublie waffels (ice cream cones) were freshly baked and were filled with whipped cream. The bounty balls were made of coconut and chocolate. Overall, we did not sell much (barely anything). But, we had a lot of fun! </p>
