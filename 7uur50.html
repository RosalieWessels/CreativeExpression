  <p>During the summer from 7th to 8th grade, we went on a trip to New York. We first drove all the way to Salt Lake City (second picture is on our way there). Then, we took the plane to Washington DC. We stayed in Washington DC for a couple of days and visited some monuments and musea. After a couple of days, we drove to New York, where I had a Cantabile performance in Carnegie Hall. Once we were back home, I worked at Shoreline Lake Boathouse for seven weeks. I was an intern and helped with the Windsurfing camps! Overall, I had a great summer! </p>
