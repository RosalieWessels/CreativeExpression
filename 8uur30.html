  <p>During 8th grade, we particpated in Technovation again. Unfortunately, without Julia. We reprogrammed and redesigned the whole app. The app also had a new name : Productiv8. Additionally, we added new features, like a Google Classroom integration to directly pull the student's homework from Google Classroom. This app is so much more advanced than our app from last year. And, we can actually use it. Right now, we are testing the app in Mrs. Massaro's 2nd and 7th period math classes. The fact that we are able to test it in school is super awesome!</p>
