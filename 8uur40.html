  <p>In 6th grade, I had the choice of signing up for three different languages. I chose Mandarin because I thought it would be so cool and interesting to learn a language that is completely different from English. And, over my two years in Mandarin class, I have learned a lot and had so much fun! While I was not even able to speak a word of Chinese before I took Mandarin, I now know way more than I used to. I can introduce myself, ask people whether they want to play basketball with me, ask them whether they know a person, etc. In conclusion, I definitely chose the right language! I have had so much fun with everyone in Mandarin and this was one of my favorite classes during my time at Egan. </p>
