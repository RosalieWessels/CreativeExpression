  <p>At the beginning of 7th grade, I joined Cantabile, a Bay Area choir. At school, I had met Sienna. Turns out, she was in Cantabile! And, she was singing the same voice part. We ended up sitting next to each other. Doing Cantabile together and having two classes together (history and science) really improved our friendship. Right now, we are really good friends! </p>
