  <p>During the first semester in 8th grade, I took Interior Design and Architecture. Although I had never designed anything ever before, I really liked this class. I had so much fun designing all the houses, restaurants, rooms, etc. The photos above show two of my projects. In the first one, we created a house out of shipping containers. We made a design and built it using special materials. My house consists of 2 shipping containers placed apart. A slanted roof is put on top of these containers, creating a nice, open space in the middle. Furthermore, my house is very light. The second project was designing our own bedroom. We took measurements from our bedroom and could design whatever we wanted. I decided to go for a bunk bed with a climbing wall on the side. This room also shows one of my favorite sports, skiing. Skis are incorporated into the climbing wall and are put as a decoration above the bed. Overall, I am so glad that I tried something new during the first semester of 8th grade. It was really a lot of fun! </p>
