    <h1>Creative Representation Rosalie Wessels</h1>
    <h3>Welcome to my Creative Representation. I am going to take you through my time at Egan. For this, I will use a clock. The clock will represent time passing (7 o'clock for 7th grade, 8 o'clock for 8th grade). Once we reach 9 o'clock, my time at Egan has reached its end and high school will begin!</h3>
